# qiskit-intro-to-qc-and-quantum-hardware
This course is an introduction to the world of quantum computing, with an exploration of some of the key quantum algorithms and their implementations using quantum circuits, as well as the quantum hardware that is designed to run these algorithms. The course was first offered during the Qiskit Global Summer School in July 2020 as a two-week intensive summer school.
